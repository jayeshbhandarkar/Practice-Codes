"""
A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here represent an array of N number 
of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt
(array).

Example 1 :
N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0].
There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array

Input :
8  - Value of N
[4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] - Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by newline

Output:
4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0

Example 2:
Input:
6 â€” Value of N.
[6,0,1,8,0,2] - Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], While input each element is separated by newline

Output:
6 1 8 2 0 0
